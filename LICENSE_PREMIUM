The Premium license applies to all entities which have been granted "premium"
status, and lasts for the duration of their premium status:

All terms of the Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL-1.5) still apply,
but with the following modifications:

- You are NOT required to disclose your own source code publicly, which
  means that this premium license is *perfect* for website/app builders.

- You are NOT required to credit this library anywhere in your own projects.
  (But if you are re-distributing OUR source code, you must of course still
  retain all of our copyright notices, and not claim our code as your own.)

- You are encouraged (but NOT required) to contribute your library
  improvements/modifications back to us. We would appreciate it, and may
  even grant you premium status if the contributions are high-quality!
